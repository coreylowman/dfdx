//! Implementations of all ops for tensors including activations like [relu()], binary operations like [matmul()], and more.
//!
//! # Generic function and struct methods
//!
//! All functionality is provided in two ways.
//! 1. The generic standalone function that takes a generic parameter. e.g. [mean()].
//! 2. The struct method for tensor structs. e.g. [crate::prelude::Tensor1D::mean()].
//!
//! The struct methods are all just pass throughs to the generic function.
//!
//! # Reductions
//!
//! There are a number of functions that reduce a dimension (e.g. [mean_last_dim()]).
//! These functions are all labeled with `*_last_dim()` at the end.
//!
//! Reducing a dimension means removing that dimension from the tensor by reducing it to 1 number.
//! For example calling [sum_last_dim()] on a `Tensor2D<2, 5>` would result in a `Tensor1D<2>`.
//!
//! See relevant functions for more examples.
//!
//! # Broadcasts
//!
//! Some binary functions need to broadcast one argument to be the same size as the other (e.g. [add_broadcast_rhs_last()]).
//! These methods are named as `<operation>_broadcast_<argument>_<dimension>()`. Currently all of the functions
//! broadcast the second argument (`rhs`). And there are version where the first dimension is broadcast and the last dimension
//! is broadcast
//!
//! 1. [add_broadcast_rhs_last()] (and others) broadcasts the last dimension
//! 2. [add_broadcast_rhs_first()] (and others) broadcast the entire array according to the first dimension in `lhs`.
//!
//! See relevant functions for more examples.
